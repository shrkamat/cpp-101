## Course Intro

This page is not an introduction to c++, but an introduction to this course.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes you have some basic programming knowledge. It's even better
if you have some experience with c++.

## Course Structure

Each chapter will offer theoretical knowledge accompanied by practical problems
to solve. While solving all the problems is not mandatory, we highly encourage
you to do so.

Please note that completing this course will not result in a certificate, nor
will it make you an expert in C++. However, it will introduce you to idiomatic
C++ and help you recognize common pitfalls and best practices.

## Course Duration

Although this course is self-paced, we recommend you dedicate about 2Hrs/day.
Ideal time to complete this course is 1 Week, try not to prolong it.
